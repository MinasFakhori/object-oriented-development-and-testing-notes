# Design Patterns 

This is a way of solving problems in software development. In other words a common solution to a common problem. Design Patterns doesn't take into account the language you are using, they are language agnostic.

The advantage of using design patterns is that they are proven solutions to common problems. They are also reusable and can be used in different projects.
